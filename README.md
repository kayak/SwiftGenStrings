# SwiftGenStrings

SwiftGenStrings is a command line application that can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard `genstrings` command for Swift sources. The latter only supports the short form of the `NSLocalizedString` function but breaks as soon as you use any parameters other than `key` and `comment` as in

```
NSLocalizedString("DATE_RANGE", value: "%@ â€“ %@", comment: "A range of dates")
```

The upstream issue is tracked [here](https://openradar.appspot.com/22133811).

## Usage

```
SwiftGenStrings [<files> ...] [-s <substitute>] [-o <output-directory>]

ARGUMENTS:
  <files>                 List of files, that are used as source of Localizable.strings generation.

OPTIONS:
  -s <substitute>         (Optional) Substitute for NSLocalizedString, useful when different macro is used.
  -o <output-directory>   (Optional) Specifies what directory Localizable.strings table is created in. Not specifying output directory will print script output content
                          to standard output (console).
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

To gather strings in current directory, run:
```
$ find . -name "*.swift" | xargs SwiftGenStrings
```

If you have any 3rd party code like CocoaPods or Carthage in your project directory, you might want to exclude it from localization. To do that, run the following:
```
$ find . \( -name "*.swift" ! -path "./Carthage/*" ! -path "./Pods/*" \) | xargs SwiftGenStrings
```

## Installation

### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)

The quickest and easiest way to install SwiftGenStrings is via Mint
```
$ mint install kayak/SwiftGenStrings
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

We tag releases and upload prebuilt binaries to GitHub. Checkout the [releases](https://github.com/kayak/SwiftGenStrings/releases) tab or go straight to the [latest](https://github.com/kayak/SwiftGenStrings/releases/latest) release.

### From Git

The project provides a `Makefile`. To export a binary run:

```
$ make release
```

The exported binary can be found under `Products/SwiftGenStrings`. Alternatively you can use `make install` to install the compiled library directly into `/usr/local/bin/SwiftGenStrings`

## Testing

Since SwiftGenStrings is a SPM package, running tests is easy:
```
$ swift test
```

## Requirements

- Xcode 12
- Swift 5.3

## Limitations

- SwiftGenStrings currently doesn't support multiple tables, only the default one - `Localizable.strings`.
- It is not possible to use `NSLocalizedString` in string interpolation e.g.: `let hello = "--- \(NSLocalizedString("Hello world!", comment: ""))"` will not pickup the localized string.
